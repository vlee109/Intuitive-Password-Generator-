# Intuitive-Password-Generator-

Why did you build this project? I build this project in a scenario where a user may want to generate a random password for various different reasons. This application is different to other random password generators as it places emphasis on security and strength of the generated password by asking the user to clearly state the length of password required and the type of characters used. 

What did you learn? From this project, I learnt how to incorporate the three different languages (HTML, CSS & JavaScript) into one project and I have gained a deeper understanding of how the three of them play a specific role in the project as a whole.
